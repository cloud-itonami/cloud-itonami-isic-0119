  "Field Operations Governor -- the independent compliance layer that
  earns the OtherCropOpsAdvisor the right to commit. The LLM has no
  notion of:
    - Whether the field a proposal targets is actually registered
    - Whether a proposal is a real actuation (`:effect :propose` only --
      this actor NEVER directly controls field equipment or executes
      anything)
    - Whether an op is inside this actor's closed coordination allowlist
    - Whether a logged field-record acreage is a plausible positive
      observation
    - Whether a supply-order's cost exceeds the escalation threshold

  This MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD.

  This actor is a back-office OPERATIONS COORDINATOR only -- direct
  field-equipment operation and finalizing a pesticide-application
  decision are categorically outside its authority (farmer/agronomist
  exclusive). The Governor enforces that boundary structurally, not by
  trusting the advisor's judgment.

  CRITICAL: Any proposal to flag a crop-health concern (pest, disease,
  frost-damage) ALWAYS escalates to a human (farmer/agronomist) for
  final sign-off. The LLM's confidence is never sufficient for crop-health
  decisions.

  Hard violations (always HOLD, no override, permanent):
    1. Field not registered (field-id missing or unknown to Store)
    2. Proposal `:effect` is not `:propose` (no direct execution, ever)
    3. Op is `:operate-field-equipment` or `:finalize-pesticide-application`
       -- direct field-equipment operation and finalizing a
       pesticide-application decision are PERMANENTLY blocked regardless
       of proposal content or confidence
    4. Op is outside the closed proposal-op allowlist
    5. `:log-field-record` with a non-positive acreage

  Soft gates (always escalate for human):
    - `:flag-crop-health-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates
    - `:order-supplies` above its category cost threshold
    - Low confidence

  This design mirrors `vegops.governor` (cloud-itonami-isic-0113) but
  specializes other-non-perennial-crop-farm back-office coordination
  concerns (field registration, closed op allowlist,
  equipment/pesticide-decision exclusion, cost threshold) rather than
  vegetable/root-crop-farm concerns."
