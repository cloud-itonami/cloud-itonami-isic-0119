(ns othercropops.store
  "Store abstraction for other-non-perennial-crop field/planting records.
  Current implementation is an in-memory map; production should migrate to
  Datomic/kotoba-server (the same seam point all cloud-itonami actors
  use). Mirrors `vegops.store` (cloud-itonami-isic-0113) in shape.

  A registered field is the minimal unit of authority: a farm's field must
  be registered before ANY proposal referencing it can be considered by
  the Governor (see `othercropops.governor`'s `field-registered`
  invariant). Field data is opaque to this namespace -- callers/backends
  decide what a field record contains (name, location, crop, acreage,
  etc); this Store only answers \"is this field-id registered, and if so
  what's on file\".")
