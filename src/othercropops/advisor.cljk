  "OtherCropOpsAdvisor -- the contained LLM/decision node. This actor's
  intelligence layer proposes back-office coordination actions (field
  record logging, planting/spraying/irrigation/harvest scheduling,
  crop-health concern flags, supply procurement) based on field state and
  operator input. The advisor is SEALED into the `:advise` step of the
  operation flow; every proposal is routed through the independent
  Governor before committing.

  The advisor makes proposals but has NO direct authority. Proposals are
  always censored by:
    1. Governor (field registration, closed-op allowlist,
       cost/crop-health gates)
    2. Phase gate (rollout stage)
    3. Human operator (for escalated actions)

  Current implementation is a mock advisor for testing. Production should
  use langchain/Claude or similar LLM backend (same seam point as
  `vegops.advisor`, cloud-itonami-isic-0113).")
